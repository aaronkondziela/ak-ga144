GreenArrays GA144A12 Libraries for KiCAD
========================================

About
-----

Contains:

* A Library for the schematic symbol
* A Module for the QFN88+1 0.4mm pitch package

Presently there's only one schematic symbol which follows package pin order.

Plans exist to create another with logical groupings of signals by bus,
function, etc.

No guarantees any of this is correct! Be careful out there.
